# Exploring Regime-adaptive Linear Models for Time Series Forecasting
### UC Berkeley STAT 230A Final Project

## Research Questions
• Is interest rate a useful predictor of U.S. unemployment rate?
• Is it possible to predict one-month-ahead unemployment rate?
• What are the models to fit unemployment rate?

## Models
• AR Model (Baseline)
• Ridge regression
• Indicator regime regression (ridge regression with an indicator on past changes to detect the regime)
• Switching autoregressive model 

## Report
See [report](https://github.com/jianzhi-1/US-Unemployment-Switching-Model/blob/main/230Areport.pdf) for details and citations.
